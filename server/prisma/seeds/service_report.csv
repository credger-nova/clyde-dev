There was oil all around cartridge and hot housing. I dried and cleaned all oil around turbo. Installed cold housing. With heat shields off I started and load unit. After inspecting and troubleshooting engine and turbo I found a pin hole on exhaust bellow. Also a small leak coming from turbo base plate o rings. I determined that with shields on all around turbo, small oil leak and leaking exhaust leak was causing oil to get all over turbo making it smoke. Informed customer.

I then used cat tools to check valve lashings on the rocker sets that were still attached. See attached picture for my findings. Adam met us with new push rods, so I replaced the broken ones, lubing all metal to metal surfaces as I went back together with it. I torqued the rocker tie down bolts to 200 then 330. Next I set valve lashings on the intake valves to .015” and exhaust valve lashings to .04” I reattached the ignition harness to its mounts on the head and found that the hole between cylinders 3&5 was missing its tie down rod. Next I put the split intake boot back on the cold side per suggestion by management until we get a replacement, placed the air filter housing back in its designated position and sealed the cracked intake boot to the best of my ability with silver tape. I then clamped down on the boot with its tie down bands. I released the unit from its lock out then cranked it. I heard what sounded like a slight chirp in the bottom end so I immediately shut the unit down and contacted management.
